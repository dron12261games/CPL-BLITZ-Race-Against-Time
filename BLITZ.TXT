Description             : Blitz: Race Against Time - Community project for
                          Doom 2 powered by MBF21 compatible source ports
                          with modified Minicharge mod by Tango

                          The goal of this project is to make ultrafast maps
                          using Special Action 10 - Close Door After 30
                          Seconds. If the door closes, the player will have
                          to go through the level from the start of the
                          level.

                          The mappers provided a lot of combat puzzles,
                          gimmick mechanics and just beautiful short maps.

                          This project is based on the "Volcanic Eruption" 
                          resourcepack by Ear1h, which in itself is a fork of 
                          "Minicharge" by Tango.

                          This project is not compatible with mods in any way!
